        <p>
          Born and raised in Indonesia, currently based in Amsterdam, I'm a
          software developer dedicated to continuously enriching my expertise,
          specializing in JavaScript with ReactJS and NodeJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my introduction to the world of tech began in recruitment, it
          proved to be a transformative one that opened my eyes to the boundless
          possibilities available to developers. The ability to craft something
          extraordinary out of nothing has ignited my passion for technology,
          and now I am wholeheartedly committed to evolving myself in the
          pursuit of being able to confidently call myself an 'inventor in
          cyberspace'. Join me on my journey! üöÄ
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from coding, I also enjoy creative endeavors such as creating
          clothes, playing the guitar, singing, and cooking different cuisines.
          In my free time, I love to play video games and go bouldering. üòÅ
